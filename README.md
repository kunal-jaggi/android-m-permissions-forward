Android ‘M‘ Permissions and Forward Compatibility 

### Introduction

Material design is a new system for visual, interaction and motion design. We
originally launched the [Topeka web app](https://github.com/Polymer/topeka)
as an Open Source example of material design on the web.

The Android version of Topeka demonstrates that the same branding and material
design principles can be used to create a consistent experience across
platforms. You can read more about it on the
[Android Developers
blog](http://android-developers.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/more-material-design-with-topeka-for_16.html).
